              <div>During last week of the EDA bootcamp, we were put in to teams of 6-7 members. In my team we worked on the project that addressed various issues related to mental health. We created a website using React, Redux, NodeJS (for APIs) and SQLite (for dev) / Postgres (for prod) database. The site was called ‘embracing blue’.
              The app was deployed to Heroku. I did a lot of work on styling the site using bulma css framework. I also used the cypress end to end JavaScript testing framework to write automated tests for the work that we were doing. 
              We used Kanban to track our backlog for this weeklong project. We managed to finish all our stories and stretch goals by the end of the week.</div>

              <div className="has-text-black-bold font is-size-4">Cooking Mums | Personal Project | EDA</div>
             <div> I learnt JavaScript and other front end related skills during EDA bootcamp. We all were encouraged to put our skills in to action to build something that we were passionate about. I decided to bring together my experience in the kitchen and the frontend skills I was learning to build ‘cooking-mums’. The idea came from my own experience of trying to look after my loved ones and trying to pursue a career in a flexible time.
              I used React, Node JS (for APIs) and SQLite (for dev) / Postgres (for prod) database to store some image data.</div>

              It was very important for us as couple that we spent more time with our children in their early age. During this time, my focus was around kids and their activities. 
              As our children started becoming more independent I started thinking about my career progression. 
              I enjoy working in a team and contributing positively to a common goal team has. 
              Software testing came up as a good option that will provide the team work
