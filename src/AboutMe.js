                 I will be writing about all the life experience and how it has been moulded so far in my 46 years of life.
                 It is been facinating, Intrestingi,inspiringand and a very challnging. I will start with one chapter of my life at a time and see how life takes place.
                I am looking for a fresh new start to my career in software testing field and at the same time challenge myself to do something completely new.
                  I love meeting people and learning about their stories through respect and empathy. I also love to share my experience as an Individual, a Mum and as a Chef.
                  My inspiration to get into the tech world are my kids. In this 'DIGI' world everything revolves around the technology and I want to be a part of that.
